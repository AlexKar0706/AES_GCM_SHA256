#AES_GCM_SHA256
Javascript variation of AES_(128/192/256)_GCM_SHA256 encryption method, which is used in TLS protocol.
##Description
###SHA256.js
Big thanks for SHA256 algorithm code in JS to [this site] (https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html "this site")
###AES.js and AES_GCM_SHA256.js
Big thanks to the [site] (https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/aes.html "site"), which has AES_CTR algorithm with AES encryption algorithm.
AES_CTR algorithm was extended to the AES_GCM_SHA256 algorithm, adding SHA256 hash algorithm with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM).
